          question:
            "Why is multi-device & multi-system use an important aspect for Creatives?",
          answer: `  <div>
        <p class="mb-6">It is widely held that most people use only one system or device at a time.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Creatives, however, own and use a number of systems - laptops for portability, workstation or desktop for large graphical works, tablets for light or precise work, and mobile phones for high resolution video and image capture.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Creatives also have more, and bigger, digital files than the average person.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Moving more large files between more systems can result in more time spent transferring data than in actual productivity.</p>
        <p>As a result, Creatives need a robust multi-system solution that maximizes time and effort on useful tasks beyond file transfer.</p>

          question: "Do Creative Professionals often use multiple systems ?",
          answer: `    <div>
        <p class="mb-6">Creative professionals often use setups that include desktop, laptop, and tablet to balance power, mobility, and convenience. This approach allows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-performance editing on desktops</li>
            <li>Portable, on-the-go access with laptops</li>
            <li>Quick sketching and annotation using tablets</li>

          question: "How many systems do digital creatives typically use?",
          answer: `<div>
        <p class="mb-6">Most Creatives will have a desktop and a laptop‚Äîwith additional devices like tablets or backup systems for specialized tasks.</p>
        <p>Intel‚Äôs Thunderbolt‚Ñ¢ research shows that Creative Individuals average over 2.5 systems; not including tablets and phones.</p>

          question: "What are the benefits of designing a multi-system setup?",
          answer: `<div><p class="mb-6">A multi-system setup is built to promote flexible, efficient workflows, access to files across platforms, and supports hybrid work environments. Ultimately, a multi-system setup ensures Creatives can maximize productivity by focusing on creative activities rather than being stuck waiting on file transfers.</p></div>`,

            "Can‚Äôt Creative Professionals simply use Wireless WiFI connections?",
          answer: ` <div><p class="mb-6">Wireless data networking - for example WiFi - is increasingly popular for accessing the Internet easily from a growing number of systems and devices without being limited by a cable.</p><p class="mb-6">However, Creative professionals have more files, and more larger files than the average user. They also move files more often between a greater number of systems compared to average users. Wireless networks are bad for this type of use.</p><p class="mb-6">Advances in new versions of WiFi have increased the number of systems that can be connected but have not significantly increased transfer speeds or improved delays that cause challenges to a Creative Professionals.</p><p class="mb-2 !text-[18px]">As a result, Creative Professionals often prefer a wired network for moving large volumes of data between local systems.</p></div>`,
